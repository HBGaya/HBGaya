# Professional Summary & Background

👋 Hi, I’m Hamza, a Flutter developer with 6+ years of hands-on experience in building and deploying dynamic, user-friendly mobile applications for both Android and iOS.

I hold a degree in Computer Science from a reputable institute in Karachi, Pakistan. I began my tech journey in 2019 as a junior PHP-Laravel developer, but soon discovered my passion for mobile development and transitioned to Flutter through self-learning—driven by a deep curiosity for new technologies.

Over the years, I’ve worked in both project-based and product-driven environments, gaining diverse exposure and tackling real-world challenges. I’m especially eager to explore opportunities in the **Fintech industry**, where I can continue to grow and contribute meaningfully.

One of my most rewarding roles was at **Get Licensed**, where I not only deepened my expertise in Flutter but also embraced Agile methodologies and refined my development practices in a collaborative, fast-paced setting.

Always open to learning, contributing, and building innovative digital experiences!

# Hobbies & Interests

Outside of coding, I'm passionate about traveling, trying new cuisines, and learning new languages. These interests have taken me across Europe—Italy 🇮🇹, Germany 🇩🇪, Switzerland 🇨🇭, Austria 🇦🇹, and France 🇫🇷—as well as to the stunning northern and southern regions of my home country, Pakistan 🇵🇰.

Currently, I'm learning German 🇩🇪 to broaden my linguistic skills and unlock new personal and professional opportunities.
