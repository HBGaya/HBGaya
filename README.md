# Professional Summary & Background

Hello my name is Hamza and I am a **flutter developer** with **5** years of experience, mostly developing and deploying intuitive and dynamic Android and IOS applications. I have done my graduation in computer science from a reputable Institute in Karachi, Pakistan and started my career in 2019 as a junior level **PHP-Laravel** developer but after a few months I switched to Flutter and did self-learning on it because of the curiosity I had for exploring the new technological stack.

I have an exposure of working in both **project-based and product-based** organizations and up for more challenges especially would love 💗 to venture myself in Fintech industry.

In my past working experience, **Get-licensed** was the first company where I thoroughly enjoyed working there. While working there I got to know about the agile practices and improved my coding standards and practices and got to explore myself much more in Flutter.

# Hobbies & Interests

Apart from the coding world or can say tech-geek world 😁. I like to travel, try out some new food and learning new languages. Following this hobby I have travelled to Italy :🇮🇹:, Germany :🇩🇪:, Switzerland :🇨🇭:, Austria 🇦🇹, France 🇫🇷 and some parts of northern and southern regions of my country 🇵🇰 as well.
