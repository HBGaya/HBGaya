# Professional Summary & Background

Hello my name is Hamza and I am a flutter developer with 5 years of experience, mostly developing and deploying intuitive and dynamic Android and IOS applications. I have done my graduation in computer science from a reputable Institute in Karachi, Pakistan and started my career in 2019 as a junior level PHP-Laravel developer but after a few months I switched to Flutter and did self-learning on it because of the curiosity I had for exploring the new technological stack.

I have an exposure of working in both project-based and product-based organizations and up for more challenges especially would love ðŸ’— to venture myself in Fintech industry.

In my past working experience, Get-licensed was the first company where I thoroughly enjoyed working there. While working there I got to know about the agile practices and improved my coding standards and practices and got to explore myself much more in Flutter.
